            <p>
                CS Games 2018 season is about to start, and we need some competitive uOttawa students to join us. We are looking for uOttawa students who love to program and want to push their skills to new limits.
                You haven't heard of CS Games? That's ok. One of the best parts about it is that you don't need any previous hackathon or competition experience.
